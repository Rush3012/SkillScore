A group project focused on developing software for the digital management of activity points for NIT Calicut students.

The current process for awarding activity points at the institute is cumbersome, involving 
manual submissions and approvals, leading to delays and inefficiencies. There is no 
centralized platform for students to track their points or for faculty to streamline approvals. A 
digital solution is required to simplify the process and provide transparency for all 
stakeholders.


In this We:
● Develop a portal for managing activity points allocation efficiently. 
● Allow students to: 
  ○ Submit requests for activity points. 
  ○ Track their approved, pending, and rejected activity points. 
● Enable faculty advisors (FA) to: 
  ○ Approve/reject activity point requests. 
  ○ Identify students with insufficient points. 
  ○ Manage category-wise cut-offs and waivers for additional approvals. 
● Provide multiple levels of approval with customizable approving authority. 
● Facilitate proof/certificate upload for activity verification. 
● Enhance transparency and reduce the administrative burden of record maintenance.
